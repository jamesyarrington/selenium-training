This repo serves as a step-by-step (via commits) tutorial of Selenium

To run the selenium tests, you need the browser you want to test, as well as its associated driver.

For example, you can use these drivers:

 - [Chrome driver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
 - [Firefox driver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

With everything set up, you can run the selenium tests with Maven

```bash
mvn install
mvn test
```
